## Luis Amancio's notes about API-SAMPLE-TEST-MASTER improving points
I believe that the codebase would benefit in some key enhancements to improve its overall functionaly and maintainability. Some of the primary focus should be on implementing TypeScript for some levels of type safety and catching potential errors during development, also the current architecture would benefit from a proper service layer to separe concerns like data fetching and processing, making the codebase more maintainable. A dependency injection system would also be better to manage external services like HubSpot client and databaase connections.
In perfomance keys, i believe that the focus should be in optimizing the multiple sequential API calls throught batch processing, particularly for contacts and meetings associations, bulk fetching and parallel requests. Implementing a caching layer would also reduce unnecessary API calls to HubSpot, the current queue system could be replaced with RabbitMQ to handle large-scale data processing more efficiently. In terms of database, some operations need optimization through proper indexing and bulk operations implementation.
Other key improvements i would suggest are improving the logging system, instead of console.log using a proper logging system would benefit in terms of monitoring.

- High Priority
    - TypeScript Implementation
    - Service Layer Architecture
    - Batch processing for API calls
- Medium Priority
    - Database optimizations
    - Logging System
- Low Priority
    - RabbitMQ transicion
    - Caching layer
